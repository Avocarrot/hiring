# Introduction

Hey there :)

- Please read the instructions carefully before start implementing your user interface. 
- If something is not clear to you please do not hesitate to get in touch with us for clarifications. We'd love to help you out!
- You can use any design software you want and feel more comfortable with it.

# Objective

The objective of this assignment is to create a User Interface for a simple web app, which will allow an advertiser to access important analytics about their campaigns. 
The exact functionality required by the users is described in the User Stories section, below.

# User profile

The users of this web app will be advertisers who are running campaigns with Glispa and they want to monitor the performance of those campaigns.

- They are comfortable with numbers.
- They demand as much flexibility as possible when it comes to slicing and dicing their numbers.

# User Stories

| User Story | Example | Notes |
|---|---|
| As an advertiser I want to view specific metrics related with my campaigns' performance | - I want to view how many Installs I had during last month <br/> - I want to view how much Spend I had in the last 24 hours | Supported Metrics: CPI (Cost Per Install), Spend, Installs, CTR (click-through rate) |
| As an advertiser I want to be able to view performance metrics for specific dimension breakdowns | - I want to view the Spend for each individual campaign for the current month <br/> - I want to view how many Installs and CPI I had in each country | Supported Dimensions: Campaign, Country, Time |
| As an advertiser I want to be able to filter my numbers based on certain dimensions | - I want to view the CPI for campaigns only in USA <br/> - I want to view the Spend only for campaign X and campaign Y | Supported Dimensions: Same as above |

# Metrics 

| Name | Description | Unit of measurement |
| Spend | The amount of dollars the advertiser spent running the campaigns| USD ($) |
| Installs | The number of users who installed the advertised apps in the campaigns| Integer |
| CTR | The click-through rate of the campaigns. | Percentage | 
| CPI | The cost per install  | USD ($)  | 

# Glispa Brand Assets

It is **not** a requirement but it would be nice if the interface is consistent with Glispa's branding.

1. A User Interface showcasing how the app will look and function. This can range from low-level wireframe(s) to high-level high-fidelity design(s). 
2. A short paragraph articulating the design thinking behind this solution. 
3. Please include any ideation phase artifacts (User flows, site-maps) etc.
