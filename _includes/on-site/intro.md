# Introduction

Hey there! 

The following document contains important information about your on-site interview at Avocarrot. 

## Before the interview

Before arriving at the on-site interview, we kindly ask you to prepare the following:

- Equipment: If you can bring your own laptop please do so that you can be as comfortable as possible. If for any reason you cannot bring one we can provide you with one plus a keyboard, monitor and mouse.
- Development environment: For the on-site interview we'll re-use your code from the previous assignment. If you are bringing your own laptop please install any dependencies or libraries needed for your code to run so that we can avoid spending too much time on setting things up.

*Note: We do not expect you to write any code before coming to the interview :)*
