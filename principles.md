# Our recruitment principles

Our recruitment process is always a work in progress as we are constantly listening to your feedback. 

However, our principles always stay the same. These principles guide how we approach recruitment.

## 1. Keep it real

We will never ask you to memorize bubble sort or the signature of an obscure Java method. We have Google and Stackoverflow for this :) 

Instead of that our process mirrors the way we work on a daily basis and uses simplified versions of our real products. Everything that you will be asked during the process is derived from real life cases, ranging from high level questions such as “how can we architect a scalable solution for problem X?” to low level ones such as “how can we test that this function is behaving correctly?”.

## 2. The recruitment process is a two way road

Joining a new team is a life changing decision so we want to provide you with all the info that you need to make an informed decision. Therefore, the process is designed in such a way that you can learn more about:

- Our products - the process contains real life scenarios from our products 
- Our team - we try to include as many people from our team as possible during the interviews
- The way we develop software and our culture - the interview process mimics our daily life and team DNA
 
Also, we strongly encourage you to speak with any member of our team during your interview to learn more about their daily life.

## 3. Be transparent

We believe in being transparent about our recruitment decisions. Whether you proceed to the next stage of the process or not we will give you our honest opinion and evaluation. 

Our team spends a lot of time evaluating assignments and interviews in order to be able to provide detailed feedback. We are only human so if you think that our evaluation was unfair then we are more than happy to discuss it.

## 4. Listen to feedback

The recruitment process is a work in progress. 

We changed it many times to reflect both the realities of the market but most importantly to incorporate changes suggested by you. During your interview we will ask you for your honest feedback about the process but you can always get in touch with us about your comments.
