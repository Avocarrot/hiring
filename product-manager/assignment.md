# Introduction 

Hey there :)

- Please read the instructions carefully before start implementing your solution.
- The assignment includes some jargon which you might not be familiar with. Do not worry about that. We do not expect you to be an ad-tech expert :) Feel free to research those terms but you do not have to. For your own convenience, we include below a table with quick explanations for the terms. 
- If something is not clear to you please do not hesitate to get in touch with us for clarifications. Weâ€™d love to help you out!

# Objective

You are a Product Manager working at an ad-tech company called Blue Banana.

Blue Banana works with multiple advertisers who run app install (user acquisition) campaigns with us. Unlike our competitors such as AppLift and InMobi, our campaign reporting is completely manual. Currently campaign performance metrics are communicated manually via csv reports attached in emails.

Your objective is to assemble a team that will develop a new product that will allow our advertisers to check their campaigns' reporting on-demand and without the need for our own account managers to get involved.

# User profile

The users of this new product will be advertisers who are running campaigns with Blue Banana and they want to monitor the performance of those campaigns. 

- They are comfortable with numbers.
- They demand as much flexibility as possible when it comes to slicing and dicing their numbers.
- The main metrics our advertisers are interested in are Spend, CTR and number of Installs.
- The main dimensions/splits our advertisers are interested in when they are looking at their metrics are Country, Time and Campaign Id.

Some example reports include:

- The total amount spent last month for all of their campaigns
- Best and worst performing campaigns in terms of number of Installs for the current month 
- A breakdown of Spend per country for this year
- A breakdown of Installs per campaign for the last 7 days 

Please note that the above examples are only a small subset of what our advertisers are interested in and keep in mind they want as much flexibility in slicing and dicing their numbers.
