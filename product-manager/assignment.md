# Introduction 

Hey there :)

- Please read the instructions carefully before start implementing your solution.
- The assignment includes some jargon which you might not be familiar with. Do not worry about that. We do not expect you to be an ad-tech expert :) Feel free to research those terms but you do not have to. For your own convenience, we include below a table with quick explanations for the terms. 
- If something is not clear to you please do not hesitate to get in touch with us for clarifications. We’d love to help you out!

# Objective

You are a Product Manager working at an ad-tech company called Blue Banana.

Blue Banana works with multiple advertisers who run app install (user acquisition) campaigns with us. Unlike our competitors such as AppLift and InMobi, our campaign reporting is completely manual. Currently campaign performance metrics are communicated manually via csv reports attached in emails.

Your objective is to assemble a team that will develop a new product that will allow our advertisers to check their campaigns' reporting on-demand and without the need for our own account managers to get involved.

# User profile

The users of this new product will be advertisers who are running campaigns with Blue Banana and they want to monitor the performance of those campaigns. 

- They are comfortable with numbers.
- They demand as much flexibility as possible when it comes to slicing and dicing their numbers.
- The main metrics our advertisers are interested in are Spend, CTR and number of Installs.
- The main dimensions/splits our advertisers are interested in when they are looking at their metrics are Country, Time and Campaign Id.

Some example reports include:

- The total amount spent last month for all of their campaigns
- Best and worst performing campaigns in terms of number of Installs for the current month 
- A breakdown of Spend per country for this year
- A breakdown of Installs per campaign for the last 7 days 

Please note that the above examples are only a small subset of what our advertisers are interested in and keep in mind they want as much flexibility in slicing and dicing their numbers. 

# Quick jargon explanation

We do not expect you to be an ad-tech expert so do not worry about ad-tech specific jargon. For your own convenience please find below a table of quick explanations.

| Term  | Explanation  | 
|---|---|
| Ad-tech | Short for Advertising Technology which is the name of our industry |
| Spend | The amount of money (in dollars) an advertiser spends on ad campaigns |
| Install | Install is an event which counts how many times an app was installed on a user device|
| Impression | Impression is an event which counts how many times an ad has been viewed |
| Click | Click is an event which counts how many times an ad has been clicked |
| CTR | Short for Click Through Rate. It's a metric that is calculated by diving Clicks / Impressions |

# Assumptions

In order to simplify the following tasks and help you focus on the main objective you can make the following assumptions:

- There is a separate tracking system which is used to collect all the metrics and dimensions we need. You can interface with this tracking system to retrieve the data you may need. 
- There is a separate authentication/login system which you can reuse in your solution. No need to worry about this one.
- There is no limitation in the budget but of course we'd prefer to minimize costs. 


# Tasks

The assignment comprises of four tasks.

[Task 1:](#task-1) Design quick wireframes for the new product 

[Task 2:](#task-2) Describe the product functionality and roadmap using high level user stories/epics 

[Task 3:](#task-3) Describe the ideal team structure and process 

[Task 4:](#task-4) Describe how you would identify if the product is successful or not 


## Task 1

Design quick wireframes for the new product. 

The level of detail for the wireframes is up to you but we'd strongly recommend to keep it as simple as possible.  

## Task 2

Describe the product functionality and roadmap using high level user stories/epics. 
 
- The level of detail for each story is up to you but at a minimum please provide the acceptance criteria.
- How would you prioritize the roadmap and release plan? Please explain the logic behind your choices.

## Task 3

Describe the ideal team structure and process based on your experience and product requirements. 

You can talk about:

- functions, skills and roles needed to deliver the product 
- team rituals
- methodology used to run the team 
- tools that you'll be using for project management
- metrics that you'll use to track the team's efficiency 

You are free to make any choice you want but please give us the reasoning behind your choices.

## Task 4

Describe how you would identify if the product is successful or not. 

# Deliverables

You can submit your assignment solution as a document which clearly outlines your answers to the different tasks. Please share with us this document by any means you find more convenient such as PDF, Google Doc etc.
