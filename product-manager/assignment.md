# Introduction 

Hey there :)

- Please read the instructions carefully before start implementing your solution.
- If something is not clear to you please do not hesitate to get in touch with us for clarifications. Weâ€™d love to help you out!

# Objective

You are a Product Manager working at an ad-tech company called Blue Banana.

Blue Banana works with multiple advertisers who run campaigns with us. Unlike our competitors such as AppLift and InMobi, our campaign reporting is completely manual. Currently campaign performance metrics are communicated manually via csv reports attached in emails.

Your objective is to assemble a team that will develop a new product that will allow our advertisers to check their campaigns' reporting on-demand and without the need for our own account managers to get involved.

# User profile

The users of this new proudct will be advertisers who are running campaigns with Blue Banana and they want to monitor the performance of those campaigns. 

- They are comfortable with numbers.
- They demand as much flexibility as possible when it comes to slicing and dicing their numbers.
- The main metrics our advertisers are interested in are Spend, click-through-rate (CTR) and number of Installs.
- The main dimensions/splits our advertisers are interested in when they are looking at their metrics are Country, Time and Campaign Id.
