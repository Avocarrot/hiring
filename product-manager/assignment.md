# Objective

You are a Product Manager working at an ad-tech company called Blue Banana.

The team has identified a problem that we'd like to address and you'll be the person leading the development of this new product.

Blue Banana works with multiple advertisers who run campaigns with us. Unlike our competitors such as X, Y, Z, we do not have a way for our advertisers to check their campaigns' metrics by themselves. Currently the campaigns' metrics are communicated manually with csv files via email with the advertisers.

Your objective is to assemble a team that will develop a new product that will allow our advertisers to check their campaigns' reporting at any given point by themselves. 

# User profile

The users of this new proudct will be advertisers who are running campaigns with Blue Banana and they want to monitor the performance of those campaigns. 

- They are comfortable with numbers.
- They demand as much flexibility as possible when it comes to slicing and dicing their numbers.
- The main metrics our advertisers are interested are Media Spend, number of Clicks and Conversions.
- The main dimensions/splits our advertisers are interested when they are looking at their metrics are Country, Publisher and Campaign Id.
