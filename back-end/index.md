# Back-end interviews

The back-end interview process has two steps:

1. An online assignment. Currently, we use one of the following exercises:
  - [Bidder exercise](online-assignment/bidder-exercise/index.md)
  - [Discrepancy exercise](online-assignment/discrepancy-exercise/index.md)

2. An on-site interview
